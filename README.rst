============
Introduction
============

PyCIM is a Python implementation of the IEC Common Information Model.

Current features include:

- Support for IEC 61970 15v13 and IEC 61968 11v05,
- Legacy support for IEC 61970 14v15 and IEC 61968 10v31,
- Profiles of the CIM, including:
  - Common Power Systems Model (CPSM) (CIM v14)
  - Common Distribution Power System Model (CDPSM) (CIM v14 and v15)
  - European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity
  (ENTSO-E) (CIM v14),
- Class and attribute documentation integrated as Python doc-strings,
- Transparent bi-directional reference handling using Python properties,
- CIM RDF/XML parsing and serialisation according to IEC 61970-552.

Installation
------------

PyCIM has no dependencies beyond Python_ 2.6 or later. It can be easy_installed
using setuptools_::

  $ easy_install PyCIM

Alternatively, download and unpack the tarball and install::

  $ tar zxf PyCIM-XX.XX.tar.gz
  $ python setup.py install

On UNIX systems, use sudo for the latter command if you need to install the
scripts to a directory that requires root privileges::

  $ sudo python setup.py install

The development Git_ repository can be cloned from GitHub_::

  $ git clone https://github.com/rwl/PyCIM.git

Quick start
-----------

To parse a CIM RDF/XML file::

  In[1]: import logging

  In[2]: logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

  In[3]: from PyCIM import cimread

  In[4]: d = cimread('path/to/input_file.xml')
  INFO:PyCIM.RDFXMLReader:Created 5660 CIM objects in 1.04s.

The ``cimread`` function returns a Python dictionary that maps UUIDs to CIM
objects.  To serialise the dictionary of objects::

  In[5]: from PyCIM import cimwrite

  In[6]: cimwrite(d, 'path/to/output_file.xml')
  INFO:PyCIM.RDFXMLWriter:5660 CIM objects serialised in 1.14s.
