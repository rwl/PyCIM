        @param width: The absolute width (thickness) of a stroke in pixels encoded as a float. The default is 1.0. Fractional numbers are allowed (with a system-dependent interpretation) but negative numbers are not. 
        @param linejoin: Enumerated values telling how line strings should be joined (between line segments). The values are represented as content strings.  The allowed values for line join are 'mitre', 'round', and 'bevel'. The default values are system-dependent. 
        @param dashArray: Encodes a dash pattern as a series of space separated floats. The first number gives the length in pixels of dash to draw, the second gives the amount of space to leave, and this pattern repeats. If an odd number of values is given, then the pattern is expanded by repeating it twice to give an even number of values. Decimal values have a system-dependent interpretation (usually depending on whether antialiasing is being used). The default is to draw an unbroken line. 
        @param lineStyle: The name of a defined line style. Usually will be an enumerated value and will be system-specific. 
        @param dashOffset: Specifies the distance as a float into the 'stroke-dasharray' pattern at which to start drawing. 
        @param opacity: Specifies the level of translucency to use when rendering the stroke. The value is encoded as a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0 with 0.0 representing completely transparent and 1.0 representing completely opaque, with a linear scale of translucency for intermediate values.
