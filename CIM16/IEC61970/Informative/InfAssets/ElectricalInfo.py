        @param bil: Basic Insulation Level (BIL) for switchgear, insulators, etc. A reference insulation level expressed as the impulse crest voltage of a nominal wave, typically 1,2 x 50 microsecond. This is a measure of the ability of the insulation to withstand very high voltage surges.

        @param b: Positive sequence susceptance. 
        @param ratedVoltage: Rated voltage. 
        @param g: Positive sequence conductance. 
        @param g0: Zero sequence conductance.
