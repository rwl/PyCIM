"""TODO: The following has been copied from a very old version of draft Part 11, so the references are wrong, but we store the knowledge here to reuse later: 'The Documentation package is used for the modeling of business documents. Some of these may be electronic realizations of legacy paper document, and some may be electronic information exchanges or collections. Documents will typically reference or describe one or more CIM objects. The DataSets package is used to describe documents tyically used for exchange of collections of object descriptions (e.g., NetworkDataSet). The operational package is used to define documents related to distribution operations business processes (e.g., OperationalRestriction, SwitchingSchedule). TroubleTickets are used by Customers to report problems related to the elctrical distribution network. TroubleTickets may be grouped and be related to a PlannedOutage, OutageNotification and/or PowerSystemResource. The Outage package defines classes related to outage management (OutageStep, OutageRecord, OutageReport).'
