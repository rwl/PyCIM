"""Contains entities to model information used by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) applications. Supervisory control supports operator control of equipment, such as opening or closing a breaker. Data acquisition gathers telemetered data from various sources.  The subtypes of the Telemetry entity deliberately match the UCA and IEC 61850 definitions.  This package also supports alarm presentation but it is not expected to be used by other applications.
